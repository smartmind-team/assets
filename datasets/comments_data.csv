B005K4Q1VI,A365A90ZY1Q80T,This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out.
B005K4Q1VI,AQ80LJNDLVZPG,"I'm pregnant and had to,give up my hot cup of coffee. I thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice? Sure does! Throw the kcup,in- and this is the best hot choc ever! I choke down my vitamins with it too! Worth it and so cheap here!"
B005K4Q1VI,A2NWIF2APZNNV0,This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.I will order this hot chocolate again.
B005K4Q1VI,A9RIPXAHUQBKY,Kids loved it. Great product at a great price.  My little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance.
B005K4Q1VI,A1NK86G7OK4E54,"Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them."
B005K4Q1VI,A3D7QMIGNEID0P,"The hot chocolate is my husband's favorite.  Service was also great, as it usually is.  Very popular now with winter coming on."
B005K4Q1VI,A103U3KR4L2ZXT,I like the rich dark smooth taste of the Grove Square cocoa. It is the best I have found in K-cups and I have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now. Delicious!
B005K4Q1VI,A2CJKQ0DOE5ARF,"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?"
B005K4Q1VI,A14Z8PWKLIRDLA,"Excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule. My Fiancee fell in love with my brother in law's and had to have one! Now, everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more. Also like the fact that there's a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from."
